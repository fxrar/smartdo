## What We're Building

A simple AI-powered task manager that helps you create and manage tasks with an AI assistant. No fancy stuff, just the basics done right with AI on top.

## Core Features (MVP)

### Task Management

- Create tasks with title, description, and due date
- Description is multiline text area, expandable so you can write as much as you want
- Update/edit existing tasks (title, description, due date)
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- View all your tasks in a clean list

### AI Chat Assistant

- Chat interface to talk with AI
- Ask AI to create tasks for you
- Ask AI to update your existing tasks
- AI understands natural language like "create a task to buy milk tomorrow"

## What We're NOT Building Yet

Keep this minimal for now. Future versions will focus on making task completion easier using popular productivity philosophies and methods from books. Think of it as leveling up from basic task manager to a smart productivity system that actually helps you get shit done better.
